The Corporate Bank segment's Provision for Credit Losses (PCL) demonstrated significant volatility over the analyzed period, culminating in a material increase in the full-year 2024 PCL ratio to 30.4 basis points of average loans, up from 22.7 bps in 2023 and 27.5 bps in 2022. This uptick in credit costs in 2024 aligns with the observed deterioration in macroeconomic sentiment, as reflected by the IFO Business Climate Index. The IFO index, particularly its expectations component, trended downwards throughout much of 2023 and 2024, signaling increasing headwinds and reduced optimism among German businesses. Similarly, the Global Composite PMI, while remaining in expansion territory (>50), indicated a slowing rate of growth, adding to the picture of decelerating economic momentum.

The Allowance for Credit Losses (ALL) balance reflects this dynamic with a notable shift in risk posture. Following a build-up in reserves during 2022 (implied by the FY2022 ALL figure), the ALL balance saw a significant decrease in the second half of 2023, falling from -1192.0m EUR in Q2 2023 to -1053.6m EUR by Q4 2023. This reduction coincided with a remarkably low PCL print of just 3.7 bps in Q3 2023, suggesting material reserve releases or write-offs exceeding provisioning, seemingly running counter to the prevailing weak IFO sentiment at the time.

However, 2024 saw a reversal of this trend, with the ALL balance increasing significantly throughout the year, ending at -1221.1m EUR, substantially above the FY2023 level. This build-up was directly driven by the elevated quarterly PCL expenses, especially the spikes observed in Q2 2024 (47.1 bps) and Q3 2024 (44.1 bps). These higher provisioning levels appear reactive, responding to the prolonged period of deteriorating business conditions and heightened uncertainty signaled by the IFO index reaching multi-year lows in late 2024. The bank seems to have adopted a more conservative stance, building reserves in response to the sustained macro weakness and the potential for credit migration. The sharp decrease in PCL in Q4 2024 (8.2 bps) and the subsequent slight drop in ALL suggest a possible stabilization or specific portfolio improvements at year-end, though this contrasts with the still subdued IFO levels at that time.

Overall, the provisioning behavior in the Corporate Bank segment, particularly the significant reserve build-up in 2024 following the H2 2023 reduction, indicates a risk management approach that is reacting to, and potentially catching up with, the prolonged and deepening negative signals from key macroeconomic indicators like the IFO Business Climate. The volatility in quarterly provisions points to sensitivity to evolving macro forecasts or specific portfolio developments.
