Provision for credit losses in 2024 are expected to be in a range of 28 to 33 basis points of average loans. The level remains elevated compared to historical norms, reflecting a continuation of conservative risk provisioning given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook.

While the underlying credit quality remains robust across key client segments, pockets of vulnerability persist â€” particularly in relation to the commercial real estate sector and cyclical industries with high leverage.

Macroeconomic indicators continue to send mixed signals: the IFO Business Climate Index has stabilized but remains below its long-term average, while the PMI Composite Index suggests modest expansion. Against this backdrop, the Group expects to maintain a prudent provisioning approach.

Uncertainty remains elevated due to geopolitical developments, inflation persistence, and potential second-order effects from tighter monetary conditions. The Group will continue to closely monitor exposures in risk-sensitive segments and adjust provisioning strategies accordingly.
